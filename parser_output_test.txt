WORK EXPERIENCE
Garuna
AI Engineer Aug 2024 – Present
● Developed a Generative AI solution for high-volume warranty claims processing, leveraging NLP model fine-tuning on a proprietary, multi-format dataset (claims, receipts, images) to automate classification and response generation.
● Led data engineering and curation for the initiative, preparing and labeling 50,000+ complex warranty claims data and engineering features (e.g., eligibility, failure codes) to ensure high-quality domain adaptation.
● Optimized a state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP model utilizing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques, iteratively optimizing hyperparameters to achieve high accuracy in domain-specific claim classification and response generation.
● Engineered a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enhance the precision of information retrieval on domain-specific knowledge, improving retrieval accuracy by 20% for more accurate claim processing.
● Architected and deployed a scalable MLOps pipeline via AWS AI services (Bedrock, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3), integrating the model with a FastAPI-based REST API and Docker for secure, low-latency, real-time handling of thousands of weekly claims.
● Implemented continuous monitoring and optimization workflows, utilizing live feedback analysis to automate document requests, refine eligibility rules, and improve fraud detection in the production environment.
● Developed a robust full-stack data pipeline including an automated web scraping component that processed over 1,000 articles monthly, reducing manual data collection time by 50 hours/month.
● Built and deployed an AI-driven dashboard on cloud infrastructure to provide real-time insights, model outputs, and sentiment analysis derived from a BERT-based classifier (89% accuracy) fine-tuned on 1,100+ customer reviews.

Archeed
AI Software Engineer Jan 2024 – Aug 2024
● Pioneered the development and deployment of two end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for intelligent recommendation and semantic search, connecting over 1,000+ architecture professionals and significantly enhancing job-to-profile recommendation accuracy.
● Architected and optimized real-time vector search pipelines using LangChain and pre-trained models (e.g., DistilBERT embeddings), resulting in a 40% improvement in content matching and retrieval speed across domain-specific data.
● Engineered and managed the scalable MLOps deployment lifecycle: containerizing model-backed microservices (Docker) and leveraging Amazon SageMaker for high-throughput, low-latency inference in the production environment.
● Implemented a multi-role architecture for intelligent job curation, integrating continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows via GitHub Actions to ensure system reliability and rapid feature iteration.
● Developed the foundational full-stack components, including RESTful APIs (Node.js) and front-end integration (Next.js/React), while managing specialized data storage using highly available Vector Databases and MongoDB.
